To run the Model, Keep the data in Data folder without changing the names.
keep the codes in src file.
The data_analysis is a .ipynb and a .py script file.
Module used:
pandas- (pip install pandas)
sklearn- (pip install sklearn)
numpy- (pip install numpy)
tensorflow- (pip install tensorflow)

The train.py contains the train model script .py.
the test.py contains the test script.
The best trained model paramters are saved as 'randomforest_weights.sav' file in src.
These weights are used to test the model and predictions are saved as a csv file named
'test_predictions' in Data folder.
The training accuracy reached is of 99.2% with a no_call_rate of 4-6.
The no_call_rate on test data is 6.
